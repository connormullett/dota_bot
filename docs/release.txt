Slarkbot releases are mostly arbitrary based on whenever I feel like a feature should
be added to the bot.

Semantic versioning is done but mostly done monotonic just for the sake of keeping track
of master. When releasing a new version of slarkbot, a PR from develop -> master is created
with the new version to be released. The changelog is archived and placed in `archive` with
a fresh changelog taking its place. Then, when master is up to date with the new changes,
will the bot be restarted manually. Slarkbots configuration file (.env) should be updated
with the new version so that grabbing changelogs for the changelog command (coming soon),
can fetch the latest release changelog.
